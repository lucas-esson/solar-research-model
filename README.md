# solar-research-model
Final Year University R&amp;D Project, simulating solar cell efficiency in underwater environments as a power option for autonomous devices.
Use SSM2D_SI code for Silicon Solar Cell model, use SSM2D_GAP code for InGaP model (Silicon vs InGaP = two different solar cell semiconductor materials).
